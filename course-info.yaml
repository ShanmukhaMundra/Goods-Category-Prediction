language: English
summary: "<p>Retail platforms are flooded with millions of products, making accurate\
  \ product categorization crucial for both retailers listing their products and customers\
  \ searching for products to purchase. This project equips you with the skills to\
  \ build a system that does just that! You will use Natural Language Processing (NLP)\
  \ techniques to understand product descriptions and discover how word embeddings\
  \ capture the contextual meanings of words in these descriptions. By the end of\
  \ the project, you will not only have a solid grasp of NLP but also have the satisfaction\
  \ of showcasing your work in a user-friendly web app!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at\
