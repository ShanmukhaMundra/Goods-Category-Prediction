<div class="step-text">
<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Congratulations on reaching the final stage of the project journey! In this stage, you'll bring your hard work to fruition by showcasing the predictions made by your trained machine learning model. The model you've built is now capable of categorizing product descriptions accurately, helping both retailers and customers navigate the vast landscape of online marketplaces more effectively.</p><p>Your task is to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to input product descriptions and instantly receive predictions about which category those products belong to. This application will serve as a practical demonstration of the effectiveness of your solution. By visualizing the predictions, users will gain confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the model, enhancing their overall user experience.</p><p>You will receive text inputs of product descriptions from streamlit. You will need to preprocess the text in a similar way you did before training. You will therefore need the following functions:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def tokenize_text(text: str) -&gt; list[str]:

    text = text.lower().strip()

    # Tokenize with regexp token with the pattern [A-z]+
    tokens = ...

    # Remove stopwords
    tokens = ...

    return tokens


def lemmatize_text(tokens: list[str]) -&gt; list[str]:

    # Instantiate WordNetLemmatizer
    lemmatizer = ...

    # Lemmatize without POS tags for performance reasons
    tokens = ...

    return tokens  </code></pre><p>Next, you will need functions to load the pickle files you need and to make the product category predictions:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def load_models():
    # Load w2v_model.pkl from the data directory
    ...

    # Load rf_model.pkl from the data directory
    ...

    # Load label_encoder.pkl from the data directory
    ...

    return w2v_model, rf_model, label_encoder


def predict_top3_categories(text_input, w2v_model, rf_model, label_encoder):

    # Tokenize and lemmatize text input
    input_tokens = ...

    # Get mean of the embeddings vector
    input_embed = np.mean([w2v_model.wv[word] for word in input_tokens if word in w2v_model.wv]
                          or [np.zeros(300)], axis=0)

    # Convert embedding vectors to a DataFrame
    input_df = ...

    # Get the predicted probabilities of the rf_model with predict_proba
    predicted_proba = ...

    # Get the top3 categories from their probability values
    top3_idx = np.argsort(predicted_proba, axis=1)[:, -3:]

    # Get predicted value classes and flatten
    top3_classes_encoded = rf_model.classes_[top3_idx]
    top3_classes_encoded_flat = top3_classes_encoded.flatten()

    # Perform inverse transformation to get the name of the classes and reshape
    top3_classes = label_encoder.inverse_transform(top3_classes_encoded_flat)
    top3_classes = top3_classes.reshape(top3_classes_encoded.shape)

    return top3_classes, predicted_proba, top3_idx

            top3_classes, predicted_proba, top3_idx = predict_top3_categories(text_input, w2v_model, rf_model,
                                                                              label_encoder)

With its simple interface, you can input product descriptions into a text area of the app and instantly receive predictions with just a click.</p><p>You can deploy your web application with Streamlit Cloud and GitHub. You will need a <a href="https://streamlit.io/cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Streamlit Cloud</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account. The <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">deploy your app</a> documentation shows how the deployment process works. That's not all. Now let's discuss the challenges you might likely encounter during deployment. The first challenge is storing large files in your GitHub repository. GitHub limits the size of files allowed in repositories to 50MB. You can overcome this challenge using the <a href="https://git-lfs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Git Large File Storage</a>. The other challenge is the use of relative paths in your repository. You may need to change these to absolute paths in your repository. Finally, you will need the <code class="language-python">requirements.txt</code> file in the root of your repository and the necessary packages required to run the program must be listed in the <code class="language-python">requirements.txt</code> file.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>You may comment out the entry point before clicking the <code class="language-python">Check</code> button.</p></div><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>To complete this stage:</p><ol><li><p>Finish the tasks in the <code class="language-python">tokenize_text</code>, <code class="language-python">lemmatize_text</code>, <code class="language-python">load_models</code>, and <code class="language-python">predict_top3_categories</code> functions</p></li><li><p>Copy and paste the main function at the end of the program</p></li><li><p>Navigate to the <code class="language-python">task</code> directory in the command line and run: <code class="language-python">streamlit run goods.py</code></p></li><li><p>Interact with the web app that pops up in your default browser by supplying it with text input.</p></li></ol><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p><strong>Example 1:</strong><em> an example of the program output for the </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Joseon-Dynasty-renewed-version/dp/B08WJQ3XJD/ref=sr_1_15?crid=3TE631WP55AJI&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IaSzCjtKAmtj9qvwufrhJzlvLNIEaYDxUcJTOVdYnuxBcunH_EOOSkGQZC2TxbFZVGALaBk-sjEkzWzBnuq_j2ZAjacCvsGd_zuOwyiSaiXTwq2qi3Bz9-9BsTnOBK3Y9sIZZcNqLYhdOoXx-RqVT19PPZVy1Oyc8zCoj22N9TORPJzQajzYandAK4dtOmWSgVGydvUWCrLzfUBRrQOkpTmfC6TTjvht7g_6AbIy6JuK6v0wxUCNBMlVw16f472VPGJse8xOkR4r1aU7LHU6_rFf52IfUZHZICFY3F9thD0.QmDvXGC_2LAIo77lCq1GSiSkZ8Nz0jP2Us6skW0-_dQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=beauty&amp;qid=1713996210&amp;sprefix=beaut%2Caps%2C645&amp;sr=8-15" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Beauty of Joseon</em></a><em> description</em></p><p>Input description:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">    Long Lasting Hydration, All Day Long: With a unique blend of 2% niacinamide and 2% squalane, Dynasty Cream expertly maintains your skin's oil-moisture balance.
